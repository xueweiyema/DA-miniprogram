# DA mini program quickstart

There's only one page that is the dutyCalendar.
All function of the duty is in the 'dutyCalendar.js'.
There is some duplicate and poor code style cause of the function is explicit.
if you wanna run in your machine,please modify the app_id and secret_id in 'dutyCalendar.js' and app_id in 'project.config.json'.

Have fun with it :)
